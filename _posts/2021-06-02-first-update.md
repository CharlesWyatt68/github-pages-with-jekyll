-Man-Bat originated as an anthropomorphic, feral, bat-like creature, lacking sentience and acting purely on instinct; the result of 
  Langstrom testing a serum that could supposedly give humans a bat's acute sonar sense on himself. Batman managed to reverse the effects, 
  but Langstrom would return as Man-Bat time and time again, albeit not necessarily as a villain, as Langstrom would sometimes retain enough 
  sanity to use his powers for good.
Several other characters have since appeared as similar Man-Bat creatures, including Langstrom's wife Francine and father Aaron.-
